417. Human Rights Watch stated that the authorities have intensified efforts to repress and silence peaceful dissidents and human rights activists.

It asked for issuing a moratorium on death penalty and to study other possibilities other than death penalty.
420. Amnesty International was concerned over longstanding systemic discrimination, particularly against women and minorities, and their unwillingness to effectively address these violations as reflected in the rejection of recommendations to ratify key human rights treaties and allowing access to the mechanisms and INGOs. It regretted the rejection of recommendations to enact and implement a law on associations and were concerned over sentencing most of the NGOs founders to lengthy prison terms after grossly unfair trials. It witnessed a continued ban and increased reprisal against peaceful protests. The new anti-terrorism law was of a concern as it defines terrorist crimes in vague terms. It was concerned with freedom of belief and religion. It noted that death penalty is applied to juveniles and continues to be applied to a wide range of non-lethal crimes.
421. United Nations Watch questioned if the report of Saudi Arabia lived up to the goal of promoting and protecting human rights. It quoted some countries recommendations that commended Saudi Arabia’s for its efforts to promote and protect human rights and particularly women and children’s rights and praised its accession to several instruments.

ODVV called for promoting and protecting interfaith dialogue.

425. The President stated that based on the information provided out of 225 recommendations received, 151 enjoy the support of Saudi Arabia and the rest are noted.
426. The head of delegation stated that he listened with interest to the presentation of States and Civil Society, and he emphasized that they are proud of its reliance and abidance by the Islamic Sharia, and proud that they are member of this distinguished Council. He emphasized that the success of the UPR depends on several key factors, and particularly, objectivity, which can contribute in achieving the goals of the UPR. Persistence is another important factor; and this requires supporting this mechanism and preventing any attempts to defeat it. Another factor to take into account is the cultural diversity of all countries, as the difference between cultures of the world is an undeniable and the attempts to impose certain cultures on communities in matters of human rights brings more harm than good to those same human rights. Hence, it is necessary to take into account the cultural diversity and reinvest it in the protection and promotion of human rights, and that this should be considered as part of the concept of “universal human rights.”

435. With regard to recommendation 125.9, the delegation recalled that the draft Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes take into account the need to harmonize the Senegalese legislation with human rights international law.
436. Moreover, with the forthcoming revision of these two codes, the Senegalese authorities have the intention of decriminalizing press offenses, aware of the role of regulator played by the media in a democracy.

456. Amnesty International welcomed Senegal’s acceptance of recommendations to make resources available to bodies working on trafficking, gender and human rights and to ensure the independence of the National Observatory of Places of Deprivation of Liberty. It raised concerns about excessive use of force by security forces to repress freedom of expression and assembly and welcomed Senegal’s acceptance of recommendations to protect these rights. It was disappointed at the Government’s decision to reject recommendations to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It was also concerned by the fate of dozens of disappeared Casamance people at the hands of Government forces. It noted the rejection of recommendations to amend legislation permitting discrimination against minorities and ensure the respect for the human rights of LGBTI persons.
457. Rencontre africaine pour la défense des droits de l’homme (RADDHO) drew attention to some of the challenges to be addressed by the Government such as the need for an assessment of the recommendations received during the first review and organize a participatory mechanism to follow-up the recommendations received during the second review; to be more firm in the enforcement of the laws concerning the prohibition of begging, the exploitation and trafficking of children, and the protection of their image through the media; to prevent the dissemination through the media of any message conveying sexist stereotypes that are unfavourable to women; to end overcrowding in prisons; and to take strong measures to stop police brutality.
458. Action internationale pour la paix et le développement dans la région des Grands Lacs (AIPD-GL) and the Comité international pour le respect et l’application de la Charte Africaine des droits de l’homme et des peuples (CIRAC) welcomed Senegal 's commitment to democracy in particular illustrated by a remarkable political alternation. They invited Senegal to consolidate its efforts in the health sector, including by strengthening the Universal Health Coverage programme. The establishment of the Senegalese Committee for Human Rights and of the National Observatory of Prisons were significant accomplishments that should be supported. They noted the efforts to consolidate peace in Casamance. In this respect, it was urgent to support the economic development plan initiated by the Government and to combat inequality in the region. They encouraged Senegal to continue the implementation of relevant recommendations including the decriminalization of press offenses and the promotion of equality in the transmission of the Senegalese nationality.
4. Concluding remarks of the State under review

The State was implementing a policy to reduce overcrowding composed of three elements. The first was a greater use of probation, as evidenced by the recent release of 800 people under this mechanism. The second element was the reform in progress of the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and the third was the construction, in 2014, of a prison with capacity for over 1,500 people.
Nigeria

463. The review of Nigeria was held on 22 October 2013 in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in relevant Council resolutions and decisions, and was based on the following documents:
(a) The national report submitted by Nigeria in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/NGA/1);
(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/NGA/2);
(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/NGA/3).
464. At its 39th meeting, on 20 March 2014, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of the review of Nigeria (see section C below).
465. The outcome of the review of Nigeria comprises the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/25/6), the views of Nigeria concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.
1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome
466. The delegation recalled that during the review in October 2013, Nigeria received 219 recommendations of which 175 recommendations were immediately accepted, 10 recommendations were rejected, and 34 recommendations were deferred for further consideration.

467. The delegation reported that of the aforementioned 34 recommendations, 9 recommendations - recommendations 137.7, 137.8, 137.28, 137.29, 137.30, 137.31, 137.32, 137.33 and 137.34 - have been accepted, while the remaining 25 recommendations, dealing mostly with abolition of the death penalty, have not been accepted. The delegation stated that the death penalty fell within the joint jurisdiction of the Federal Government and the 36 State Governments. Consequently, it was not feasible to implement a moratorium on the death penalty in light of Nigeria’s Federal System guaranteeing a measure of autonomy to its federating units.

468. The delegation stated that the ECOWAS Court of Justice granted an injunction against the execution of the death penalty, and directed the Federal Government to continue to abide by its commitment to maintain a moratorium on the death penalty. The Federal Government will respect this Court order, as dialogue on the death penalty continued.

469. The delegation noted that the Criminal Procedure Act and Criminal Procedure Code provided that no person can be sentenced to death if he was under the age of 18 years at the time of the offence. The courts have strenuously applied these provisions even where heinous crimes have been committed.

470. Noting that Nigeria did not accept Recommendation 137.6 on the amendment of Article 12 of the Constitution, the delegation stated that the rationale for Article 12 was to ensure that international obligations, as expressed in treaties between Nigeria and other countries, were brought to the attention of the Legislature, in order to promote an inclusive government, and to ensure harmony between municipal laws and international obligations. However, a constitutional review process was taking place in the National Assembly, and the outcome may include amendment of Section 12 along the lines suggested by the recommendation.

471. In relation to recommendation 137.7 which was accepted, the delegation stated that Article 33, Order 237 of the Nigerian Police Act was presently under review, and the National Assembly has taken note of the recommendation.

472. In relation to recommendation 137.8, which enjoyed the support of Nigeria, the delegation stated that those harmful traditional practices were deeply rooted in ancient traditional beliefs and cultural practices, and could not be exorcised overnight. The Federal Government through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, the National Human Rights Commission and State Ministries of Culture and Tourism will continue to educate the people and raise awareness on this matter.

473. The delegation stated that the Federal Government encouraged educational institutions to adopt a progressive approach to the introduction of sex education in their curricula. Advocacy on sex education will continue on a progressive basis given the cultural sensitivities on the part of parents, religious bodies and other stakeholders in the education of young people.

474. The delegation stated that Nigeria was unable, at this time, to accept Recommendations 137.26 and 137.27 on the issue of early marriage. Marriage fell within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Federal Government and the State Governments. At the Federal level, the National Assembly has passed the Child Rights Act, which prohibits the marriage of any girl-child below the age of 18. To ensure a nation-wide application of this principle, the Federal Government has stepped up advocacy to encourage the various State Governments to enact their own version of the Child Rights law. Twenty-six of the 36 states have, to date, enacted the desired Child Rights laws. In addition, the Government at all levels is engaged in advocacy to discourage girl-child marriages through various measures, including subsidized education for girls.

475. While noting the acceptance of Recommendation 137.31, the delegation emphasized that there were no restrictions in the formation or activities of Trade Unions in Nigeria. Trade Unions will continue to exercise their mandate fully and freely, pursuant to Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the Trade Union Act.

476. The delegation noted that Recommendation 137.32 on forced evictions was accepted and stated that evictions have stopped. It also clarified that those evictions carried out in Lagos and Rivers States by the respective State Governments were undertaken for the purpose of urban renewal projects, and to pro-actively save the residents from the hardship and negative effects of potential coastal flooding. In future, when it becomes necessary to evacuate residents of any community for any overriding public purpose, appropriate notices as well as effective compensation and resettlement plans will be put in place.

477. Noting that recommendation 137.34 enjoys the support of Nigeria, the delegation stated that the proposed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) before the National Assembly was designed to address those concerns contained in the recommendation.

478. With regard to recommendation 137.9 which Nigeria rejected, the delegation stated that in light of the investigation within the Joint Task Force (JTF), there was no incident of massacre or any organized abuse of the human rights of the people by the JTF in Baga.

479. The delegations stated that the Nigerian Security Agencies fighting Boko Haram were under strict directives to operate within the dictates of global best practices and rules of engagement that adhere to applicable humanitarian and international human rights laws.

491. Angola commended the efforts taken by Nigeria to protect the rights of women and other vulnerable groups, particularly persons with disabilities. It thanked Nigeria for accepting the recommendation made by Angola which covered this area.
492. Benin noted with satisfaction the qualitative progress contained in Nigeria’s second national report.

497. The Centre for Reproductive Rights noted that over one quarter of women and adolescents between the ages of 15 and 49 years have an unmet need for effective contraception. Unsafe abortion and lack of access to post-abortion care has led to a significant number of deaths. It called for inter alia sexuality education in schools, an increase in family planning services, access to safe abortions and post abortion care, and a review of the restrictive abortion law.
498. Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) welcomed Nigeria’s acceptance of the recommendations to pass the Violence against Persons Prohibition Bill and urged prompt passage of this Bill. It also welcomed Nigeria’s acceptance of the recommendation to implement the National Action Plan on Security Council Resolution 1325. It noted that the Arms Trade Treaty recognised the link between gender-based violence and the arms trade, and called on Nigeria to establish a national commission to oversee the application of the Treaty.
499. International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) stated that anti-homosexuality legislation in Nigeria was unacceptable and could not be justified by national and cultural values. Popular support for the anti-homosexual legislation was irrelevant as it was a State’s role as a guarantor of human rights to protect equality without distinction of any kind. It was deplorable that Nigeria not only failed to address rampant homophobia, but also enshrined it in domestic law. IHEU called for the acceptance of recommendation 138.1 to 138.10.
500. Amnesty International (AI) stated that there has been a sharp increase in the attacks by gunmen suspected of being members of Boko Haram. The Government has also committed violations in response to Boko Haram. AI welcomed Nigeria’s acceptance to provide accountability for these violations. It also welcomed the acceptance of the recommendation to prevent forced evictions and urged the Government to put in place legal protections and other safeguards. AI called on Nigeria to repeal the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act; and to establish a moratorium on executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty.
501. Jubilee Campaign (JC) stated that the Constitutional provisions on freedom of religion were not always enjoyed by religious minorities, particular since the adoption of the Sharia penal code by 12 northern states. Non-Muslims in these states are generally denied the rights, opportunities and protections Muslims enjoy. The situation has been exacerbated by the emergence of Boko Haram. While prioritisation of counter insurgency was essential, Nigeria must also address the systematic discrimination that contributed to a climate facilitating impunity with regard to religion related violence, and the general undermining of the rule of law in these areas.
502. The World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) stated that Nigeria has not fulfilled its commitments made its review in 2009 to pursue its fight against corruption. Following the second review, there were increasing doubts with regard to the Government’s stand against corruption, particularly in light of allegations missing oil revenues in the sum of $ 20 bn between January 2012 and July 2013. WEA stated that there was no security for ordinary citizens and human rights were being violated.
503. International lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) expressed concern by the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act. Innocent Nigerians have been targeted based on perception of their sexual orientation and gender identity, resulting in mass arrest and mob violence, with perpetrators enjoying impunity. ILGA informed of specific emblematic cases. The Act is being used for the purposes of a witch hunt. ILGA expressed disappointed that no a single recommendation on homosexuality was accepted by Nigeria.
504. Rencontre Africaine pour la defense des droit de l’homme welcomed the reforms undertaken in the area of social, economic and cultural rights since. It urged Nigeria to implement the recommendations on corruption, religious fundamentalism, violence against women, and discrimination against minorities. It encouraged the promotion of inter-cultural and religious dialogue so as to combat religious violence.
505. Association for Progressive Communication (APC) welcomed Nigeria’s acceptance of recommendations relating to CEDAW, violence against women and children, education, and to human rights defenders, journalists and other civil society actors. It noted that Nigeria accepted similar recommendations during its review in 2009, but no significant progress has been made. APC recommended a discontinuation of on-line interference and of efforts to conduct internet surveillance. It expressed concern by the rejection of a number of important recommendations.
4. Concluding remarks of the State under review
506. The President stated that based on the information provided, of the 219 recommendations received, 184 enjoyed the support of Nigeria and the remaining recommendations were noted.
507. The delegation expressed its appreciation to all delegations, NGOs and civil society groups for their questions, candid comments and kind suggestions on how to improve Nigeria’s human rights profile. In response thereto, the delegation stated that Nigeria was fully committed to deepening its democracy through free and fair elections; there was no policy of targeting any group and that the Anti-Gay marriage Law was strictly the outcome of a democratic process, which no democratic country can actually ignore; there were no violations of rights of persons in detention, particularly in relation to Boko Haram insurgents; the Constitution guaranteed freedom of religion and the Federal Government, the State Governments and other stakeholders were working closely in various inter-religious platforms to attain religious harmony; every effort was being made through institutional, legal and legislative means to reduce and ultimately eliminate corruption; and finally, Nigeria was one of the freest countries in terms of press freedom, both online and off-line.
508. The delegation reiterated that Nigeria will, as always, continue to play an active role in the work of the Council, with a full commitment to facilitate the promotion and protection of the global ideals of human rights in our country and our sub-region. In this regard, Nigeria acknowledged the importance and usefulness of the UPR mechanism, in particular, the potential it holds for guiding the United Nations and its member States towards realization of the fundamental freedoms for people everywhere. For Nigeria, the UPR process and its outcomes have been a worthwhile experience that will guide policy formulation and execution for the foreseeable future.

515. Mexico asserted that the message of the international community was clear: Mexico must consolidate a state policy on human rights, on the basis of important legislative and public policy changes that have been launched in recent years. In particular, the constitutional reform of the justice penal system (2008) and the human rights reform (2011).

518. The delegation asserted that Mexico has accepted the vast majority of the recommendations, reiterating its firm commitment to comply with them. Mexico stated that, in full compliance with both national and international legal frameworks, it is not possible to implement a small number of recommendations, but a detailed explanation has been provided to explain this position.
519. The delegation stated that Mexico is determined to build a society of rights, convinced that this is an unavoidable duty of any democratic State. It added that it is in an unprecedented time of construction of political agreements, which was crucial to achieve the reforms adopted in 2013 on education, politics, elections, transparency, public finances and telecommunications, which recognize and extend human rights.
520. The delegation asserted that Mexico is committed to strengthening the international human rights system and the UPR as part of its foreign policy, and that the President had recently reiterated its commitment with the UPR recommendations. It highlighted that unlike four years ago, the response to the recommendations for this review reflects an inclusive process of broad consultation and transparency, motivating the publication of the Addendum prior to this session.

521. Mexico informed that its second UPR participation coincided with the development of the National Human Rights Programme 2014-2018, to be presented shortly, which responds to the need to link international recommendations to public policy.
522. Mexico also considered that the accepted recommendations will promote the protection of persons in situation of vulnerability who suffer from any kind of discrimination and stated that it will continue to propose initiatives to ensure the protection of human rights of migrants, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, as well as the empowerment of women.
523.

This report informs about the actions to advance on issues such as military justice, enforced disappearances, protection of human rights defenders and journalists, and eradication of violence against women, among others. The delegation affirmed Mexico has accepted all the recommendations on these issues, as well as those relating to education, sexual and reproductive rights, poverty eradication, public safety, social inclusion, reduction of inequalities, impunity and gender stereotypes.

The Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juarez underscored that torture remains a systematic practice in Mexico, remaining almost universally in impunity, and stated that judicial authorities should exclude evidence obtained under a human rights violation. It stressed that while torture is used as a modus operandi, no advances will be achieved in the professionalization of the police and in criminal investigations. It stated that the Council has the function to address situations that require its attention at any moment, not only under UPR, and that in this moment, Mexico required its attention.
542. Save the Children International welcomed the acceptance of recommendations on children’s rights. It urged, inter alia: to engage in a revision and reform process of all legislation to ensure compliance with international standards, to adopt a Comprehensive Child Rights Act by 2016 coordinating government institutions, to take measures to ensure that the rights of migrant children are fully respected, and to guarantee access to a universal health care system prior to, during and after child delivery.
543. Tlachinollan described the reality of the State of Guerrero as one where poverty and generalized violence becomes a systematic violation of rights, aggravated by the lack of civilian controls over Armed Forces. It highlighted the persistence of discriminatory practices and the existence of 40 criminal procedures against indigenous authorities from Guerrero for exercising their right to self-determination. It stated that while Mexico informed about protocols on consultations with indigenous peoples, secondary laws violate daily the right to consultation of indigenous peoples.
544. Action Canada for Population and Development welcomed Mexico’s acceptance to carry out follow-up work on UPR outcomes. It noted strong gender stereotypes and significant obstacles to the realization of women’s and LGBT human rights and sexual and reproductive rights. It appreciated Government’s attempts to create legal provisions to protect from discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation and sexual identity but was deeply concerned that measures taken do not recognize the concept of gender identity. It urged Mexico to adopt federal laws and policies these types of discrimination.
545. Amnesty International stated that the situation in Mexico is critical, with ongoing patterns of enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, arbitrary detention, routine attacks on women, human rights defenders, journalists, and migrant population, calling to strengthen measures to investigate them. It urged Mexico to act on the recommendations made to ensure prompt, full and impartial investigation and prosecution of those responsible for arbitrary detentions, torture and ill-treatment and excessive use of force routinely used by the security forces and the police. It called to reform the Military Justice Code to ensure prosecution in the civilian justice system and regretted Mexico’s decision not to abolish arraigo detention.
546. Jubilee Campaign raised concerns at the continuing and frequent violations of the right to freedom of religion or belief and persistent religious discrimination. It stated that local authorities attempt often to enforce uniformity and dominant forms of worship and belief, at the expense of the rights of religious minorities, and affirmed that Mexico should end the exemption from prosecution that the perpetrators of religious offenses often enjoy. It highlighted that, where possible, the Government must protect church leaders under threat by illegal groups, investigate thoroughly crimes against them, and prioritize the protection of those which speak out against corruption and human rights violations.
547. Grupo de Información en Reproducción Elegida acknowledged the acceptance by Mexico of the recommendations regarding sexual reproductive rights. It stated it had informed the State about the need to reject the recommendation made on the protection of life from conception, as it was contrary to human rights standards, and that despite this, Mexico presented an unclear position, based on reasons that were not discussed in the dialogue process with civil society. It added that a protection of the pre-born life consistent with human rights does not have to impede their exercise, and that they were discouraged by the lack of determination of the Mexican Government to defend reproductive rights of women. It called upon all authorities to effectively comply the recommendations on reproductive health.
4. Concluding remarks of the State under review
548. The Vice President stated that based on the information provided, out of 176 received recommendations, 166 enjoy the support of Mexico, additional clarification was provided on another 2 recommendations, while the rest is noted.

It asserted that article 57-2 of the Military Justice Code is going through a reform process to ensure consistency with the Constitution and international standards and highlighted that the Prosecutor General’s Office for Military and military judges have adopted a practice of declining their competence in cases of alleged human rights violations in favour of civilian authorities.
550. The delegation underscored that there is an ongoing work to design protocols that guarantee the consultations to indigenous peoples in cases of development projects that have an impact on them, and that these protocols are being designed on the basis of concrete processes and experiences such as the consultations made to the Yaqui tribe and the El Espinal community (Oaxaca).

559. Mauritius reaffirmed the Government’s unrelenting commitment to upholding the highest standards of human rights at the national level and to engage effectively in the universal promotion and protection of human rights.

560. It was recalled that Dr. the Hon. Arvin Boolell, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade, who led the Mauritius delegation to the UPR review in October had highlighted that the priority of the Government is to provide its people with a quality of life based on human dignity, equality of treatment, economic empowerment and social justice. It was added that Mauritius continues to build a nation where the welfare of its citizens remains at the very core of development. Mauritius has always endeavoured to foster its development based on the universal values of democracy, good governance, the rule of law, promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It has adopted an inclusive approach in addressing human rights issues including relevant stakeholders such as the national human rights institutions, non-governmental organisations and the civil society in both mainland Mauritius and in the island of Rodrigues.

561. It was noted that recommendations received during UPR Review related, inter alia, to domestic violence; racial discrimination; review of legislations on child protection; increased protection for the disabled; improvement of human rights situation of working migrants as well as accession and ratification to certain international human rights instruments. Mauritius assured the Council that it valued those recommendations highly and that serious consideration was being given to them while it further pursued its efforts to promote and protect the human rights of its citizens.
562. Mauritius reiterated what had been stated during the Working Group, that the National Human Rights Action Plan 2012-2020 addresses most of the recommendations it had received. It underlined that the Action Plan lays a lot of emphasis on the strengthening of international cooperation in the field of human rights, greater realization of social, economic and cultural rights, the strengthening of women´s rights as well as safeguarding the rights of vulnerable persons including elderly persons, children and persons with disabilities.
563. Mauritius then highlighted action that had been adopted in a number of fields.
564. On the issue of disabilities, it was recalled that Mauritius had adopted measures to implement a policy of inclusive education with a view to addressing the previous lacuna relating to the education of disabled children. The aim of these measures is to achieve parity in the government funding for disabled and other children. It was added that once such parity is achieved, the Government shall withdraw the reservation made on Article 24.2(b) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
565. Additionally, the Ministry of Social Security, National Solidarity and Reform Institutions of Mauritius is also in the process of reviewing its Policy Paper and Plan of Action on Disability in the context of the Post-2015 Disability inclusive Development Agenda of the United Nations.
566. It was indicated that in the previous month, the Government of Mauritius had set up a steering committee at the level of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology to monitor the report and promote collaboration amongst the stakeholders on the Online Child Sexual Abuse Reporting Portal so as to reengineer the online child sexual abuse filtering mechanism.
567. As regards protection from domestic violence, it was noted that an Advisory Committee has been established under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer of the Law Reform Commission to reinforce the legal framework for the protection of victims of domestic violence.
568. As regards the ratification of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, it was reiterated that Mauritius being a small and densely populated island with limited resources, had not yet adopted a policy or laws to grant refugee status to foreigners. However, cases of demand for refugee status and political asylum were treated on a case by case basis and the assistance of friendly countries and relevant agencies was requested for their re-settlement.
569. With regard to the proposal to accede to the Optional Protocol of the ICCPR, Mauritius recalled that all death sentences imposed have been commuted to sentences of penal servitude for life. However, the Constitution had not yet been amended to prohibit the imposition of death sentences. Amendment of the Constitution cannot be effected unless it is supported by votes not less than three quarters of the members of the National Assembly.
570. As regards the recommendation relating to Mauritian citizens of Chagossian origin who were shamefully evicted by the United Kingdom from the Chagos Archipelago which forms an integral part of the territory of the Republic of Mauritius, the delegation pointed out that the long-standing struggle of Mauritius to effectively exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago and the right of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago, as Mauritian citizens, to be resettled in the Archipelago are indissociable. It was added that the Government of Mauritius will continue to press for the early and unconditional return of the Chagos Archipelago to the effective control of Mauritius, whilst firmly supporting the right of return of Mauritian citizens of Chagossian origin and other Mauritians to the Archipelago. As for the question of reparation to the victims, Mauritius stated that it is of the view that this should be addressed by the United Kingdom which had forcibly removed the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius.
571. It was also reiterated that the Constitution guarantees to all citizens the right to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on race, caste, colour, sex, religious beliefs, place of origin and political opinions. In addition, a number of legislative measures had been adopted to warrant effective exercise of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, to maintain a conducive environment for equal opportunities for all and to sustain a cohesive and harmonious society in our multi-racial and multi-ethnic island state.
572. Mauritius stated that it fully subscribes to the principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that it respects the principle of universality of human rights and considers human rights to be indivisible with economic, social and cultural rights as important as civil and political rights. The manner in which all rights are attained and implemented must nevertheless take into account specific national circumstances and its multi-ethnic makeup.
573. In conclusion, the delegation reiterated its gratitude for the support extended during its second review.

It further stated that it does not recognize the sovereignty claim by the Mauritian Government. It added that the British Government has expressed regret about the events of the 1960s and the 1970s, and substantial compensation had rightly been paid which had been held to be full and final settlement of the Chagossian claims both by the UK and EU courts.

Jordan

597. The review of Jordan was held on 24 October 2013 in conformity with all the relevant provisions contained in relevant Council resolutions and decisions, and was based on the following documents:
(a) The national report submitted by Jordan in accordance with the annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/JOR/1);
(b) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/JOR/2);
(c) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/JOR/3 and Corr.1).
598. At its 40th meeting, on 20 March 2014, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of the review of Jordan (see section C below).
599. The outcome of the review of Jordan comprises the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/25/9), the views of Jordan concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group.
1.Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and on the outcome
600. The delegation expressed Jordan’s full commitment to work with all partners to ensure the success of the UPR mechanism. It noted that Jordan had already started the implementation of the recommendations. For example, the granting of Jordanian civil rights to the children of Jordanian women married to non-Jordanians had recently been approved. Jordan had also begun studies on the introduction of electronic systems to provide daily information on arrested persons and monitor their legal status.
601. Turning to the 13 recommendations which were to be examined and recommendation 119.1 in particular, the delegation highlighted Jordan’s contributions to, and its leading role in, the establishment of the International Criminal Court. Jordan was not opposed to the privileges and immunities, but considered that the requisite security and political stability which was necessary to implement them did not currently exist in the Middle East.
602. In relation to recommendation 119.2, the delegation noted that Jordanian law provides for the criminalization of all acts that constitute violence against women and highlighted the Law on Protection from Domestic Violence.
603. With respect to recommendation 119.3, the Jordanian Constitution considers all citizens to be equal before the law and therefore sex cannot be used to discriminate against citizens. All the rights enshrined in national legislation granted to the males are enjoyed by females and the same applies to duties.
604. Referring to the inheritance rights of women and recommendation 119.4, the delegation noted that Jordanian legislation is derived from shariia law and it includes a comprehensive formula in this field. Women sometimes receive half of an estate and sometimes greater. Any breach of this formula would threaten a woman's right to inheritance. The Personal Status Law, which regulates inheritance issues, was subject to lengthy public discussion and a consensus was achieved confirming the citizens’ acceptance of this law.
605. In relation to divorce, the Personal Status Law gives the husband the right to divorce and also protects women. A woman can divorce whenever she wants, and retains all her rights arising from the marriage contract as in cases when the husband initiated the divorce. Women have the right to petition for a separation in court in cases of sexual or physical disorder. The Personal Status Law allows a woman to be the custodian of a minor whether she has custody or not.
606. Turning to recommendation 119.5, the constitutional amendments of 2011 provided for the explicit criminalization of all acts of torture. There have been many court rulings invalidating confessions made under torture. In addition, the sentences of the State Security Court which applies the Criminal Procedure Code are subject to appeal under this code.
607. When there is evidence that any public security official has engaged in acts of torture or other crimes which constitute human rights’ violations, the evidence is forwarded to the Police Court. This is an independent court which incorporates all standards and guarantees of a fair trial. Its decisions are subject to appeal before the Court of Cassation. Public security personnel do not enjoy any kind of immunity from criminal prosecution.
608. In relation to recommendation 119.6, a manual for prosecutors for the investigation of cases of torture has been issued and workshops on its application have been held for judges and all prosecutors. Public security officials also participated in these workshops. The Civil Code has provisions regulating compensation for victims of abuse.
609. Turning to recommendation 119.7, the mitigating circumstances for a crime alleged to have been committed for reasons of honour must be proved in accordance with Article 340 of the Penal Code. This imposes an additional burden of proof on the accused. Therefore removing the mitigating circumstances would adversely impact the prosecution of crimes under the pretext of honour.
610. In relation to recommendation 119.8, many of the amendments to the Penal Code increased the level of respect for human rights including, for example, the abolition of the death penalty for a number of crimes, as well as amendments to Article 208 to increase the sanctions for punishing the perpetrators of the torture. Accordingly, abolishment of these amendments is unacceptable.
611. With respect to recommendation 119.9, the Government was open to any proposal to amend the Press and Publications Law. The law was promulgated to regulate the work of websites and increase transparency and accountability in the circulation of information. Amendments have been introduced to the Law on the Association of Journalists, broadening participation and taking into account the electronic media and that the level of the possible fines has been decreased. The requirement for prior permission to publish applies to all forms of media: The goal is organizational and it should be noted that there is no prior censorship on what is published. The Government continues dialogue with all concerned to provide a suitable environment and legal framework that ensures the freedom and responsibility of the electronic media.
612. In response to recommendation 119.10, it should be noted that the registration procedures apply to all media, not just websites. All media must abide by the same rules and Jordan attaches great importance to having a modern media system compatible with the potential reform and constitutional amendments, and creating an environment conducive to freedom of the media.
613. With respect to recommendation 119.11 it had been decided to start prepare draft amendments to the Law on Associations.
614. Turning to recommendation 119.12, the Government had worked recently with civil society and this was reflected in the draft amendments to the Law on Associations. There was no intention to impose restrictions on foreign funding. The measures were intended simply to ensure that funds are channelled to the right purpose for which they are allocated.
615. In responding to recommendation 119.13, the delegation noted that the Constitution guarantees the protection of refugees. Jordan has received successive waves of refugees since 1948 and has always protected them and provided for their basic needs despite its scarce resources. In 1997, a memorandum of understanding was signed with UNHCR which included respect for the principle of non-refoulement, refugees’ rights in education, religion, access to justice, employment and exemptions from residency and immigration fees.
2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council on the review outcome
616. During the adoption of the outcome of the review of Jordan, 12 delegations made statements. The statements of the delegations that were unable to deliver them owing to time constraints[29] are posted on the extranet of the Human Rights Council, if available.
617. Sri Lanka appreciated Jordan’s constructive engagement with the UPR and noted the acceptance of most of the recommendations made to it. It commended the attention being given to the amelioration of living standards and noted that the Government continued to strengthen the institutional framework for human rights and recommended adoption of the outcome for Jordan.
618. The State of Palestine thanked Jordan for its clarifications in relation to the report. It commended it for strengthening its infrastructure and increasing respect for human rights as well as its cooperation with the UPR mechanism whereby it considered all the recommendations after discussion with the stakeholders. It welcomed the acceptance of the majority of the recommendations including its own recommendation relating to the rights of domestic workers.
619. Sudan expressed its appreciation for the full responses provided by the delegation, Jordan had proven its will to protect and promote of human rights. It noted the implementation of recommendations accepted during the first UPR. It also appreciated the acceptance of the recommendation which it had made. It believed that the HRC should provide any support and solidarity required by Jordan in the field of human rights.
620. UNICEF welcomed initiatives such as the endorsement of the Juvenile Law and looked forward to the review of other legislation relating to children. It commended Jordan’s commitment to reporting to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and called for the ratification for the Optional Protocol on a Communications Procedure. It noted steps towards ending corporal punishment in schools and violence against children. UNICEF commended Jordan’s generosity to refugees and encouraged other efforts to protect refugees, including reviewing its decisions relating to their livelihoods. It also reiterated its readiness to provide technical support relating to foster care and social protection.

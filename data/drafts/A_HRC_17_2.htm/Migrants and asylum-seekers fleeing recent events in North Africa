Affirming that crimes and human rights violations against migrants continue to pose a serious challenge and require a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for their eradication,
1. Expresses its alarm at the continuing vulnerable situation of migrants and asylum-seekers who have suffered untold hardship and, in some cases, even death as they attempt to flee recent events in North Africa;
2. Also expresses its alarm at the fact that, after having been compelled to make dangerous journeys, including in crowded and unsafe boats, the above-mentioned migrants are subjected to life-threatening exclusion, detention, rejection and xenophobia;
3. Further expresses its alarm at the fact that, since the beginning of the recent events in North Africa, there have been several reports of boats sinking and, in this regard, notes with sadness the death at sea of several hundreds of people, mostly African citizens, after their boats sank and that, according to accounts of survivors and family members, more than one thousand two hundred people are still unaccounted for;
4. Recognizes the efforts made by countries of destination on the northern shores of the Mediterranean sea to host migrants and asylum seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa, as well as the greater efforts made by neighbouring north African countries, which impose on them a disproportionate burden, and commends, for their solidarity, the Governments and people of those countries, humanitarian actors, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration, the International Committee of the Red Cross, international and local non-governmental organizations and those Governments and individuals who have supported their activities;
5. Reaffirms the need to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, including in the context of people fleeing events in North Africa;
6. Emphasizes that countries of destination should deal with the arrival of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa, including its humanitarian dimension, in accordance with international obligations under international human rights law;
7. Calls for a comprehensive inquiry by countries of destination into the very troubling allegations that sinking vessels carrying migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing the recent events in North Africa were abandoned to their fate despite the ability of European ships in the vicinity to rescue them, and welcomes the call made by the Council of Europe in this regard on 9 May 2011;
8. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa described in the present resolution, to report to the Human Rights Council at its eighteenth session and to provide updates thereon;
9. Requests the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and all other relevant special procedures mandate holders to pay particular attention to the situation of persons fleeing by sea, including from recent events in North Africa, and who are denied assistance or rescue when approaching the countries of destination, and to report regularly thereon to the Human Rights Council.

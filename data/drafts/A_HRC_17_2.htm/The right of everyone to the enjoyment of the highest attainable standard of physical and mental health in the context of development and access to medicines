17/14 The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health in the context of development and access to medicines
The Human Rights Council,
Reaffirming that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a human right as reflected in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as, with respect to non-discrimination, in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that such a right derives from the inherent dignity of the human person,
Recalling Human Rights Council resolution 15/22 of 30 September 2010 and all resolutions and decisions on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, and Council resolution 12/24 of 2 October 2009 on access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,
Emphasizing the importance of the promotion and protection of all human rights for all and their interrelationship with global public health, development, poverty eradication, education, gender equality and the empowerment of women,
Recalling the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia, establishes that States should take, at the national level, all measures necessary for the realization of the right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, such as health services,
Recalling also the ministerial declaration on implementing the internationally agreed goals and commitments with regard to global public health of the 2009 high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council,
Concerned that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including through access to medicines that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality, in particular essential medicines, vaccines and other medical products, and to health-care facilities and services, still remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal remains remote,
Recalling that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States to ensure access for all, without discrimination, to medicines, in particular essential medicines, that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality,
Recognizing the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,
Recalling that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the Agreement does not and should not prevent members of the World Trade Organization from taking measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, accordingly, while reiterating the commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of members of the Organization to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all, and further recognizes, in this connection, the right of members of the Organization to use, to the full, the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose,
Concerned about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of poverty,
Concerned also that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, and aware that there is a need to respond to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, which represent a leading threat to human health and development,

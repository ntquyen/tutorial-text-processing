23/14 Access to medicines in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health
The Human Rights Council,
Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

Reaffirming also that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a human right that derives from the inherent dignity of the human person,

Recalling Human Rights Council resolution 17/14 of 17 June 2011 and all previous resolutions and decisions on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, as well as Assembly resolution 67/81 of 12 December 2012 on global health and foreign policy,

Recalling also the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia, establishes that States should take, at the national level, all measures necessary for the realization of the right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their access to basic resources, such as health services,

Noting with concern that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, especially for those living in poverty, this goal is becoming increasingly remote,

Recognizing the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,

Recalling that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the Agreement does not and should not prevent members of the World Trade Organization from taking measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, accordingly, while reiterating the commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of members of the Organization to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all, and further recognizes, in this connection, the right of members of the Organization to use, to the full, the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which provide flexibility for this purpose,

Regretting the high number of people still without access to affordable, safe, efficacious and quality medicines, and underscoring that improving such access could save millions of lives every year, and noting with deep concern that more than one billion people still do not have access to essential medicines,

Concerned about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of poverty,

Concerned also that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, which represent a leading threat to human health and development, and recognizing the urgent need for further measures at the global, regional and national levels to prevent and control such diseases in order to contribute to the full realization of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,

23/4 The right to education: follow-up to Human Rights Council resolution 8/4
The Human Rights Council,
Reaffirming Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 of 18 June 2008, and recalling all other Council resolutions on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 20/7 of 5 July 2012, and the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the subject,
Reaffirming also the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant international instruments,
Bearing in mind General Assembly resolution 67/18 of 28 November 2012 on education for democracy,
Deeply concerned that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, progress towards many of the Education for All goals set for 2015 is slowing down, and that most of these goals are unlikely to be met, although progress in some of the world’s poorest countries shows what can be achieved with the commitment of national Governments and aid donors, including greater numbers of children attending pre-school, completing primary school and making the transition to secondary education,
Mindful of the role that the full realization of the right to education for all plays in helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, noting in this regard the commitments relating to education contained in the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, including to ensure quality education and progression through the school system, and the need to ensure that the right to education is central in the context of the post-2015 agenda,

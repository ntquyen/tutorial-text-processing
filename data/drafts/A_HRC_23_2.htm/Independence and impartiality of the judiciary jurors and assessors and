23/6 Independence and impartiality of the judiciary, jurors and assessors, and the independence of lawyers
The Human Rights Council,
Guided by articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2, 4, 9, 14 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,

Recalling the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct and the United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems,

Recalling also all previous resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council, as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and on the integrity of the judicial system,

Convinced that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal profession, an objective and impartial prosecution able to perform its functions accordingly and the integrity of the judicial system are prerequisites for the protection of human rights and the application of the rule of law, and for ensuring fair trials and that there is no discrimination in the administration of justice,

Recalling that prosecutors should, in accordance with the law, perform their functions fairly, consistently and expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights, thus contributing to due process and the smooth functioning of the criminal justice system,
Noting with concern the increasingly frequent attacks on the independence of judges, lawyers, prosecutors and court officials, in particular threats, intimidation and interference in the discharge of their professional functions,
Recalling that every State should provide an effective framework of remedies to redress human rights grievances or violations and that the administration of justice, including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments, is essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and sustainable development,

Recalling also that it is essential to ensure that judges, prosecutors, lawyers and court officials possess the professional qualifications required for the performance of their functions through improved methods of recruitment and legal and professional training, and through the provision of all necessary means for the proper performance of their role in ensuring the rule of law,

Emphasizing that judges, prosecutors and lawyers play a critical role in upholding human rights, including the absolute and non-derogable right of freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,

Recognizing the importance of bar associations, professional associations of judges and prosecutors, and non-governmental organizations in the defence of the principle of the independence of judges and lawyers,

Stressing the role that independent and effective national human rights institutions in accordance with the Paris Principles can and should play in strengthening the rule of law and in supporting the independence and integrity of the judicial system,

Recognizing that legal aid is an essential element of a fair, humane and efficient system of administration of justice that is based on the rule of law,

Reaffirming Human Rights Council resolution 17/2 of 6 July 2011 on the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and acknowledging the importance of his or her ability to cooperate closely, within the framework of his or her mandate, with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including in the fields of advisory services and technical cooperation, in the effort to guarantee the independence of judges and lawyers,

3. Stresses that the term of office of judges, their independence, security, adequate remuneration, conditions of service, pensions and the age of retirement should be adequately secured by law, and that the security of tenure of judges is an essential guarantee of the independence of the judiciary and that grounds for removal must be explicit with well-defined circumstances provided by law, involving reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their functions, and that procedures upon which the discipline, suspension or removal of a judge are based should comply with due process;
4. Calls on States to ensure that prosecutors can perform their functional activities in an independent, objective and impartial manner;

6. Calls upon States, in collaboration with relevant national entities, such as bar associations, associations of judges and prosecutors, and educational institutions, to provide adequate training, including human rights training, for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, both on initial appointment and periodically throughout their career, taking into account regional and international human rights law and, where applicable and relevant, concluding observations and decisions of human rights mechanisms, such as treaty bodies and regional human rights courts;

7. Underscores the importance for States to develop and implement an effective and sustainable legal aid system that is consistent with their international human rights obligations and takes into account relevant commitments and good practices, and to ensure that legal aid is available at all stages of the criminal justice process, subject to appropriate eligibility criteria and in accordance with international human rights law;

12. Encourages Governments that face difficulties in guaranteeing the independence of judges and lawyers, the objectivity and impartiality of prosecutors and their ability to perform their functions accordingly, or that are determined to take measures to implement these principles further to consult and to consider the services of the Special Rapporteur, for instance by inviting her to their country;

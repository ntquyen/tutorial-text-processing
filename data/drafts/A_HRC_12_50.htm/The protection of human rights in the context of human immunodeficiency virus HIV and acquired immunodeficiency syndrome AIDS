Recalling also the Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as “the Guidelines”), referred to in the above-mentioned resolutions and annexed to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/33, which provide guidance to ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of HIV,
Recalling further Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2003/29, 2004/26 and 2005/23 and Council decision 2/107 of 27 November 2006, and their acknowledgement that prevention and comprehensive care and support, including treatment and access to medication without discrimination, for those infected and affected by pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are inseparable elements of an effective response and must be integrated into a comprehensive approach to respond to such pandemics,
Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2002/31 of 22 April 2002, 2003/28 of 22 April 2003, 2004/27 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/24 of 15 April 2005, in which the Commission reaffirmed the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and also recalling Council resolution 6/29 of 14 December 2007, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,
Taking note with interest of the reports by the United Nations special procedures that have devoted specific attention, in the context of their mandates, to the critical intersection between the protection of human rights and an effective response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
Noting with grave concern the fact that, according to estimates by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, at the end of 2007, 33 million people were living with HIV, including 2.7 million people newly infected with HIV in 2007, and that a disproportionate number of them are presently in sub-Saharan Africa, and also deploring the 25 million lives lost to HIV/AIDS since the epidemic was identified,
Recalling the urgent need to scale up efforts significantly towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010, affirmed by Governments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS on 2 June 2006, and emphasizing the concern at the increasing instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, and reiterating that such discrimination affects the enjoyment of human rights and can lead to particular targeting of people living with HIV/AIDS and members of key populations affected by the epidemic, as well as increased vulnerability to HIV, and also recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen programmes or measures to eradicate multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, in particular by adopting or improving penal or civil legislation to address these phenomena,
Expressing appreciation for the important role played by the engagement of civil society in the response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,

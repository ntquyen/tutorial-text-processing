Deeply concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the particular targeting or vulnerability to violence of girls and some groups of women, such as women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and internally displaced women, migrant women, women living in rural or remote communities, destitute women, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in situations of armed conflict, women who are otherwise discriminated against, including on the basis of HIV status, and victims of commercial sexual exploitation,
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the recognition by the ad hoc international criminal tribunals that rape can constitute a war crime, a crime against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide or torture,
Stressing the importance of a comprehensive, well-coordinated, effective and adequately resourced response by the United Nations system to all forms of violence against women and girls,

5. Also calls upon States to support initiatives undertaken by women’s and non-governmental organizations on the elimination of violence against women and girls and to establish and/or strengthen, at the national level, collaborative relationships with relevant non-governmental and community-based organizations, and public and private sector institutions, aimed at the development and effective implementation of provisions and policies relating to violence against women and girls, including in the area of support services, assistance redress and empowerment of victims;
6. Urges States and the United Nations system to give attention to, and encourages greater international cooperation in, systematic research and the collection, analysis and dissemination of data, including data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant information, on the extent, nature and consequences of violence against women and girls and on the impact and effectiveness of policies and programmes for combating this violence, and, in this context, welcomes the establishment of the Secretary-General’s coordinated database on violence against women, and urges States and the United Nations system to regularly provide information for inclusion in the database;
7. Encourages States to supply information on all forms of violence against women and girls in their reports submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other relevant treaty bodies;
8. Also encourages States to implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) to contribute to their efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls;
9. Notes with appreciation the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, including her latest report on the political economy of women’s human rights (A/HRC/11/6);
10. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to consider in future reporting the needs of women who experience multiple forms of discrimination, and to examine effective measures to respond to those situations;
11. Stresses the importance of accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, its causes and consequences throughout its work, and in this regard:
(a) Encourages States to ensure that eliminating violence against women and girls is given due attention in the work of the Council, including relevant Council processes and debates, including the universal periodic review;
(b) Requests the special procedures of the Council to ensure that due consideration is given to violence against women and girls within their respective mandates;

(e) Invites the Office of the High Commissioner to include violence against women and girls in its reporting on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations system;
12. Requests United Nations organs and bodies, specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations, and encourages the human rights treaty bodies, to continue to give consideration to violence against women and girls within their respective mandates;
13. Calls upon relevant United Nations entities within their respective mandates to support, upon request, the follow-up by States to relevant recommendations of the special procedures, concluding observations of treaty bodies and outcomes of the universal periodic review to prevent violence against women and girls, protect victims of such violence and prosecute the perpetrators;
14. Stresses that challenges and obstacles remain in the implementation of international standards and norms to address the inequality between men and women, and violence against women in particular, and pledges to intensify action to ensure their full and accelerated implementation;
15. Decides to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all forms of violence against women, its causes and consequences, as a matter of high priority, in conformity with its annual programme of work.

At the 32nd meeting, on 30 September 2010, the representative of France introduced draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.24, sponsored by France and co-sponsored by Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Uruguay.

15/18 Arbitrary detention
26. It is noted that this draft resolution has been adopted following the indication, orally, that there are additional resource requirements in the implementation of the terms of the draft resolution. The detailed programme budget implications contained in this oral statement is hereby submitted, as a record, to the Council.
27. This oral statement is made in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.
28. Under the terms of paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.24, the Human Rights Council would:
(a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for a further period of three years, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1991/42 and 1997/50 and with Human Rights Council resolution 6/4;
(b) Request the Secretary-General to provide all necessary assistance to the Working Group, particularly with regard to the staffing and resources needed for the effective fulfilment of its mandate, especially in respect of field missions;
(c) Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize in 2011, within existing resources, a two-day event to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the Working Group.
29. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that a total sum of $1,299,000 per annum or $2,598,000 per biennium would be required to implement the ongoing activities called for under paragraphs 11 and 12, as follows:


United States dollars
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management
1 075 500
Section 23, Human Rights
181 700
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva
41 800
Total
1 299 000
30. The estimated requirements enumerated under paragraph 3 above have been included under sections 2, 23, and 28 E of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 for the activities of the Working Group. No additional appropriations are therefore required to implement activities falling under the terms of paragraphs 11 and 12 of the draft resolution.
31. With respect to paragraph 13, it is estimated that a total amount of $349,800 would be required for conference servicing, travel of five members and one consultant for three months for organization and participation in the two-day event to be held in 2011, as follows:


United States dollars
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management
267 300
Section 23, Human Rights
80 800
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva
1 700
Total
349 800
32. The requirements enumerated in paragraph 30 above for the holding of the two-day event have not been included under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011.
33. Currently, the Secretary-General has been requested to implement various decisions and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including the fifteenth session of the Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly relating to human rights issues, which have financial implications on the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 estimated at $9,527,800 of which, the Secretary-General is proposing to absorb an amount estimated at $3,662,700.
34. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010–2011 or 2012–2013, as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee against Torture to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session in 2011 and 2012.
35. With regard to the biennium 2012–2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 would be required in the biennium 2012–2013 relating to Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated that the programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the current fifteenth session of the Council will command new resources in the biennium 2012–2013 of about $4,963,300.
36. Against this background of the various mandates and its related additional resource requirements in the biennium 2010–2011, the Council is hereby informed that, since at this juncture the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 has been tasked with absorption of significant amounts of requirements for additional resources, it is proposed that General Assembly approval be sought for all additional resources arising from the Council’s mandates that cannot be met from within available resources. Although the Secretariat will endeavour to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the additional requirements, the Secretariat, after having exhausted all possibilities of absorption, may have to seek additional resources under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011, through established procedures.
37. The Human Rights Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its resolution 63/263, endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions that there is merit in presenting an annual report on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions and resolutions of the current session will only be presented to the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Given that some of the draft resolutions of the current session require immediate action and that their implementation requires additional resources, including those for conference services, which are not included in the calendar of conferences for the biennium 2010–2011, the Secretary-General could issue an addendum to his report (A/65/333) only upon the timely submission of the Council’s report on the decisions and resolutions of its fifteenth session to the Assembly at the main part of its sixty-fifth session.
38. With regard to paragraph 12, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

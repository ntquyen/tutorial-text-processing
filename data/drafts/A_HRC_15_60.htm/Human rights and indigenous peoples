9. Under the terms of paragraphs 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.5, the Human Rights Council would, decide to hold:
(a) On an annual basis, and without prejudice to the outcome of the Council’s review of its work and functioning, an interactive dialogue with the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples following the presentation of its report, within existing resources;
(b) Within existing resources, a half-day panel, at its eighteenth session, on the role of languages and culture in the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples’ well-being and identity.
10. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that requirements of $40,200 would arise to implement the activities called for in paragraphs 7 and 8.
11. The estimated requirements of $40,200 have not been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 to carry out the activities foreseen in the draft resolution. The Secretary-General will, to the extent possible, meet the additional requirements from within the provisions approved for section 23 of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011. Additional requirements are therefore not anticipated upon the adoption of the draft resolution by the Council.
12. With regard to paragraphs 7 and 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

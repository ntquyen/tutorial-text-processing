Recognizing the importance of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association to the full enjoyment of civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights,

15/21 The rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association
42. It is noted that this draft resolution has been adopted following the indication, orally, that there are additional resource requirements in the implementation of the terms of the draft resolution. The detailed programme budget implications contained in this oral statement is hereby submitted, as a record, to the Council.
43. Under the terms of paragraphs 4, 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.23, the Human Rights Council would:

(c) Request the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate by the Special Rapporteur.
44. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, an estimated total amount of $511,800 would be required to implement activities in response to the terms of the draft resolution, as follows:
(a) An estimated amount of $51,900 required under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) would provide for conference services for the organization of a two-day consultation each year (interpretation for two days each year in English/French/Spanish; translation in English/French/Spanish for a concept note and background paper; translation of agenda and compendium of best practices into the official languages of the United Nations;
(b) Under section 23 (Human Rights), an estimated amount of $458,200 would provide for (i) travel and daily subsistence allowance for the Special Rapporteur, on two field missions each year to Geneva to attend the annual consultation meeting of special procedures mandate holders; to submit a yearly report to the Human Rights Council; to New York, to submit a yearly report to the General Assembly and to attend annual consultations with member States and other relevant stakeholders; (ii) travel and daily subsistence allowance for OHCHR staff to accompany the expert during field missions; (iii) travel of one treaty body member or special procedures mandate holder to Geneva to participate in each of the three annual consultations; (iv) travel of five experts (one from each region) for each of the three annual consultations; (v) consultant services (9 months at P-3 level each year) to support the special rapporteur with highly specialized expertise; (vi) one staff member at P-3 level (12 months per annum), one staff member at G-5 level (12 months per annum) and six months general temporary assistance at the P-3 level; and (vii) general operating expenses for services, communications and supplies during field missions;
(c) Under section 28 E (Administration, Geneva), an estimated amount of $1,700 would provide for conference-servicing support services.
The estimated requirements are summarized as follows:


United States dollars
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management
51 900
Section 23, Human Rights
458 200
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva
1 700
Total
511 800
45. The requirements of $511,800 have not been included under sections 2, 23 and 28 E of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011.
46. Currently, the Secretary-General has been requested to implement various decisions and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including those of the fifteenth session of the Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly relating to human rights issues, which have financial implications for the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 estimated at $9,527,800, of which the Secretary-General is proposing to absorb an amount estimated at $3,662,700.
47. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010–2011 or 2012–2013 as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee against Torture to request the Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session in 2011 and 2012.
48. With regard to the biennium 2012–2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 will be required in the biennium 2012–2013 relating to Human Rights Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated that the programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the fifteenth session of the Council will command new resources in the biennium 2012–2013 of about $4,963,300.
49. Against this background of the various mandates and its related additional resource requirements in the biennium 2010–2011, the Council is hereby informed that, since at this juncture, the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 has been tasked with absorption of significant amounts of requirements for additional resources, it is proposed that General Assembly approval be sought for all additional resources arising from the Council’s mandates that cannot be met from within available resources. Although the Secretariat will endeavour to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the additional requirements, the Secretariat, after having exhausted all possibilities of absorption, may need to seek additional resources under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011, through established procedures.
50. Since the mandate is for a three-year period, provisions of $1,023,600 would be required for the biennium 2012–2013. The requirements for 2012–2013 would be considered within the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012–2013.
51. The Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its resolution 63/263, endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, that there is merit in presenting an annual report on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions and resolutions of the current session will only be presented to the Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Given that some of the draft resolutions of the current session require immediate action and that their implementation requires additional resources, including those for conference services, which are not included in the calendar of conferences for the biennium 2010–2011, the Secretary-General could issue an addendum to his report (A/65/333) only upon the timely submission of the Council’s report on its decisions and resolutions adopted at its fifteenth session to the Assembly during the main part of its sixty-fifth session.
52. With regard to paragraph 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
15/22 The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health
53. Under the terms of paragraphs 1, 12, 13 and 14 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.28, the Human Rights Council would:
(a) Decide to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health for a further period of three years;
(b) Request the Special Rapporteur, with the assistance of OHCHR, in consultation with States, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to prepare, within existing resources, a thematic study on the realization of the right to health of older persons, including main existing challenges and best practices;
(c) Decide to address the thematic study requested in paragraph 12 above, within existing resources, in a panel within the programme of work of its eighteenth session, and invites OHCHR, the World Health Organization, Advisory Committee members and other relevant United Nations bodies and agencies to participate in an interactive dialogue on the study in the Council;
(d) Request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to provide all necessary resources for the effective fulfilment of the Special Rapporteur’s mandate.
54. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that provisions of $133,300 per annum or $266,600 per biennium would be required to implement the activities under its terms, including (a) $51,800 per annum or $103,600 per biennium under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management); (b) $79,800 per annum or $159,600 per biennium under section 23 (Human Rights); and (c) $1,700 per annum or $3,400 per biennium under section 28 E (Administration, Geneva). The requirements have been included under the aforementioned sections of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011; however, experience has shown they are at a minimal level.
55. While no additional appropriations would be sought from the General Assembly, the Secretariat will to the extent possible in implementing the terms of the draft resolution meet additional requirements that would arise such as (a) staff to support the Special Rapporteur in undertaking his/her studies and during field visits; and (b) additional travel for the Special Rapporteur and/or experts for formal consultations with partners and stakeholders, including appropriate conference services for those meetings, within resources available under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011.
56. Since the period of extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur extends into the biennium 2012–2013, in drawing up the estimates for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012–2013 a thorough review of the expenditure pattern of the activities of the Special Rapporteur will be carried out and addressed in that context.
57. With regard to the paragraphs of the draft resolutions cited in paragraph 53 above, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 64/243 of 24 December 2009, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

15/26 Open-ended intergovernmental working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an international regulatory framework on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military and security companies
73. Under the terms of paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8 of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.22, the Human Rights Council would:
(a) Decide to establish an intergovernmental open-ended working group with a mandate to elaborate a legally binding instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the impact of the activities of private military and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights, on the basis of the principles, main elements and the draft text for a possible convention proposed by the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination;
(b) Also decide that the intergovernmental open-ended working group should meet every year until the fulfilment of its mandate, that it should have a session of five working days a year and that its first session would take place no later than May 2011;
(c) Affirm the importance of providing the intergovernmental open-ended working group with the necessary expertise and expert advice to fulfil its mandate, and would decide that the members of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries who were involved in the elaboration of the principles, main elements and the draft text for a possible convention should participate in the intergovernmental open-ended working group as resource persons;
(d) Request the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide the working group with all the necessary financial and human resources for the fulfilment of its mandate.
74. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that a total amount of $242,700 would be required to implement activities in response to its terms as follows:
(a) An estimated amount of $135,600 required under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) would provide for conference services in all official languages for five days per year;
(b) Under section 23 (Human rights), an estimated amount of $103,200 would provide for (i) travel and daily subsistence allowance for members of the working group to Geneva to attend the annual consultation meeting of special procedures mandate holders, to submit a yearly report to the Human Rights Council; to each of the three annual consultations; to New York, for consultation with Committee on the Status of Women, UN-Women and other relevant entities and bodies; and (ii) three months’ general temporary assistance at the P-4 level, and two months’ general temporary assistance at the General Service level;
(c) Under section 28 E (Administration, Geneva), an estimated amount of $3,900 would provide for conference-servicing support services.
The estimated requirements are summarized as follows:


United States dollars
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management
135 600
Section 23, Human Rights
103 200
Section 28 E, Administration, Geneva
3 900
Total
242 700
75. The requirements enumerated in paragraph 74 above have not been included under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011.
76. Currently, the Secretary General has been requested to implement various decisions and resolutions of the Human Rights Council, including those adopted at the fifteenth session of the Council, and in response to various mandates of the General Assembly relating to human rights issues, which have financial implications for the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 estimated at $9,527,800, of which the Secretary-General is proposing to absorb an amount estimated at $3,662,700.
77. The Council is also informed that there are other mandates that are likely to command additional requirements in the programme budget in the bienniums 2010–2011 or 2012–2013, as follows: (a) the entry into force of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; (b) the decision of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session (two additional weeks of sessional meetings per year) in 2012 and 2013; and (c) the decision of the Committee against Torture to request the General Assembly to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session in 2011 and 2012.
78. With regard to the biennium 2012–2013, in his report (A/65/333), the Secretary-General also stated that an additional amount of $283,100 would be required in the biennium 2012–2013 relating to Human Rights Council resolution 14/8. It is also estimated that the programme budget implications of draft resolutions tabled at the fifteenth session of the Council would command new resources in the biennium 2012–2013 of about $4,963,300.
79. Against this background of the various mandates and its related additional resource requirements in the biennium 2010–2011, the Council is hereby informed that, since at this juncture the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 has been tasked with absorption of significant amounts of requirements for additional resources, it is proposed that General Assembly approval be sought for all additional resources arising from the Council’s mandates that cannot be met from within available resources. Although the Secretariat will endeavour to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the additional requirements, the Secretariat, after having exhausted all possibilities of absorption, may need to seek additional resources under the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 through established procedures.
80. Since the mandate is for a three-year period, provisions of $485,400 would be required for the biennium 2012–2013. The requirements for 2012–2013 would be considered within the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012–2013.
81. The Council will recall that the General Assembly, in part V of its resolution 63/263, endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, that there is merit in presenting an annual report on the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council (A/63/541). As such, the programme budget implications of the decisions and resolutions of the current session will only be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. Given that some of the draft resolutions of the current session requires immediate action and that their implementation requires additional resources, including those for conference services which are not included in the calendar of conferences, for the biennium 2010–2011, the Secretary-General could issue an addendum to his report (A/65/333), only upon the timely submission of the Council’s report on the decisions and resolutions of its fifteenth session, to the Assembly during the main part of its sixth-fifth session.
15/27 The situation of human rights in the Sudan
82. Under the terms of draft resolution A/HRC/15/L.35 (amendment to A/HRC/15/L.3), the Human Rights Council would decide to renew the mandate of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan for a period of one year, who shall assume the mandate and responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 9/17 and 11/10; request the independent expert to engage with the newly created human rights forums in the Sudan as well as the human rights sections of the African Union, the United Nations Mission in the Sudan and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and to submit a report to the Council for consideration at its eighteenth session; and request the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance to discharge the mandate fully.
83. Should the draft resolution be adopted by the Human Rights Council, it is estimated that a sum of $77,700 per annum would be required to implement activities under its terms.
84. Estimated requirements of $77,700 per annum or $155,400 per biennium have been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 for the activities of the independent expert. No additional appropriations would be required should the Council adopt the draft resolution.

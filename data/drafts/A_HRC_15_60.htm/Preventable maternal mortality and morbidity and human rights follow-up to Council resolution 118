3. Calls upon States to collect disaggregated data, including data disaggregated by age, rural/urban location, disability and other relevant criteria, in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity to ensure effective targeting of policies and programmes to address discrimination and the needs of disadvantaged and marginalized women and adolescent girls, and to permit effective monitoring of policies and programmes, including through the adoption of national-level targets and indicators reflecting the main underlying causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, and through the development of appropriate health programmes;

6. Requests States to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements, including by honouring existing commitments and considering new ones, and the exchange of effective practices and technical assistance to strengthen national capacities, and to integrate a human rights perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women has on maternal mortality and morbidity;
7. Encourages States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels to address the interlinked root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as poverty, malnutrition, harmful practices, lack of accessible and appropriate health-care services, information and education and gender inequality, and to pay particular attention to eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls;

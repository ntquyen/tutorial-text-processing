5. Welcomes the holding, on 1 June 2011 and pursuant to decision 16/116 of the Human Rights Council, of a panel discussion on the issue of human rights of victims of terrorism, which raised awareness of the importance of addressing the human rights of victims of terrorism in the determined effort by the international community to deal with the scourge of terrorism and as part of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms;

12. Notes with concern measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal basis for detention and due process guarantees, the unlawful deprivation of the right to life, the deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation of liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, and the return of suspects to countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, and limitations to effective scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures;

14. Urges States, while countering terrorism, to respect the rights to be equal before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, as provided for by international law, including international human rights law, such as article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee law;
15. Reiterates the concerns expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/168 with regard to measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, and urges all States to take all necessary steps to ensure that persons deprived of their liberty, regardless of the place of arrest or detention, enjoy the guarantees to which they are entitled under international law, including the review of their detention and other fundamental judicial guarantees;

24. Stresses the importance that relevant United Nations bodies and entities and international, regional and subregional organizations, in particular those that are participating in the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which provide technical assistance relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism to consenting States, include, as appropriate and where consistent with their mandates, the respect of international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law and refugee law, as well as the rule of law, as an important element of technical assistance that they offer to States related to counter-terrorism, including by drawing on the advice of, and otherwise ensuring the ongoing dialogue with, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council within their mandates and the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant stakeholders;

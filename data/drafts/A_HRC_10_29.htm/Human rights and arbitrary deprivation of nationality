10/13 Human rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality
The Human Rights Council,
Guided by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations,
Guided also by article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality,
Reaffirming its resolution 7/10 as well as all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the issue of human rights and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality,
Recognizing the right of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, renunciation or loss of nationality in accordance with international law, and noting that the issue of statelessness is already under consideration by the General Assembly within the broad issue of State succession,
Noting the provisions of international human rights instruments and international instruments on statelessness and nationality prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of nationality, inter alia, article 5, paragraph (d) (iii) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; article 24, paragraph 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; articles 1 to 3 of the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women; article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; article 18 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness; and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons,
Recalling that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by international human rights and refugee law as well as instruments on statelessness, including, with respect to States parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto,
Stressing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis,
Recalling General Assembly resolution 63/148 of 18 December 2008, in which, inter alia, the Assembly urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and reducing statelessness and protecting stateless persons,
Noting the important work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in seeking to address and prevent the problem of statelessness, as guided by, in particular, the conclusion of its Executive Committee on the identification, prevention and reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) 2006,
Mindful of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of 3 December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations because of nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language,
Recalling General Assembly resolutions 55/153 of 12 December 2000 and 59/34 of 2 December 2004 on the nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States,
Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General submitted in accordance with Council resolution 7/10[1] and the contributions made to it by States and other stakeholders,
Recognizing that arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects persons belonging to minorities, and recalling the work done by the independent expert on minority issues on the subject of the right to nationality,[2]
Expressing its deep concern at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of persons of their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status,
Recalling that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to statelessness and, in this regard, expressing concern at various forms of discrimination against stateless persons that violate the obligations of States under international human rights law,
Emphasizing that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected,
1. Reaffirms that the right to a nationality of every human person is a fundamental human right;
2. Recognizes that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, is a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms;
3. Calls upon all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their nationality on grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and legislation render a person stateless;
4. Urges all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to avoiding statelessness, consistent with fundamental principles of international law, in particular by preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State succession;
5. Encourages States that have not acceded to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons to consider doing so;
6. Notes that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality;
7. Expresses its concern that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be affected by poverty, social exclusion and legal incapacity;
8. Recognizes the special needs of children for protection against arbitrary deprivation of nationality;
9. Calls upon States to ensure access of persons arbitrarily deprived of their nationality to effective remedies, including, but not limited to, restoration of nationality;
10. Urges relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and the appropriate treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to continue to collect information on the issue of human rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources and to take account of such information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their reports and activities conducted within their respective mandates;
11. Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the right to nationality, with emphasis on the issue of arbitrary deprivation of nationality, including in cases of States succession, taking into account the information gathered pursuant to Council resolution 7/10, similar studies conducted by the Subcommission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and other relevant sources of information, and to present it to the Council at its thirteenth session;
12. Decides to continue its consideration of this matter at its thirteenth session under the same agenda item.

10/27 Situation of human rights in Myanmar
18. In paragraphs 18, 20 and 21 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.28 (adopted as resolution 10/27), the Council:
(a) Decided to extend for one year the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1992/58 and 2005/10, and Council resolution 7/32;
(b) Requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a progress report to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and to the Council in accordance with its annual programme of work;
(c) Called upon OHCHR to provide the Special Rapporteur with all necessary assistance and resources to enable him to discharge his mandate fully.
19. A total amount of $72,700 per annum ($145,400 per biennium) would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to implement the activities arising from the terms of the resolution, as follows:
(a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations, to present his/her report to the Council and the General Assembly, two field missions per year ($56,300 per annum, or $112,600 per biennium);
(b) Travel of staff to accompany the Special Rapporteur during field missions ($10,400 per annum, or $20,800 per biennium);
(c) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous expenses during field missions ($6,000 per annum, or $12,000 per biennium).
20. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the Special Rapporteur have been included under section 23 (Human Rights) of the programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009. Since the period of the terms of the draft resolutions extends to the biennium 2010–2011, it is considered that the requirements for that period would be met within the provisions included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011. No additional appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution.
21. With regard to paragraph 21, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.

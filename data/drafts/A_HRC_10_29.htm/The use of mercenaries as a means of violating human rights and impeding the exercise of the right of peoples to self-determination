10/11 The use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination
6. In paragraphs 13, 16 and 18 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.24, the Council:
(a) Requests the Working Group:
(i) To consult with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and experts on the content and scope of a possible draft convention on private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and other military security-related services on the international market, and an accompanying Model Law, and other legal instruments;

(b) Requested OHCHR to continue to support the Working Group by convening regional governmental consultations on this matter, in conformity with paragraph 15 of General Assembly resolution 62/145, with the remaining three to be held before the end of 2010, bearing in mind that this process may lead to the holding of a high-level round table of States, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, including private military and security companies, in the current context, and their respective obligations for the protection and promotion of human rights and in reaching a common understanding as to which additional regulations and controls were needed at the international level;

7. The requirements of the activities of the Working Group are regarded as perennials and have therefore been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009 and the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011. However, the resource requirements with regard to an anticipated regional consultation in Africa have not been considered within the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011.

(a) Travel of five members of the Working Group ($29,200, under section 23);
(b) Travel of 52 representatives for two working days ($135,200, under section 23);

8. The additional $316,600 required to implement the activities for the regional consultation in Africa will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session in a revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011. No additional appropriations would be required for the biennium 2008–2009 as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution.
9. With regard to paragraph 18, attention is drawn to the provisions of section IV of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
10/23 Promotion and protection of cultural rights and respect for cultural diversity
10. In paragraphs 6, 8, 9 and 10 of draft resolution A/HRC/10/L.26 (adopted as resolution 10/23), the Council:
(a) Decided to establish, for a period of three years, the mandate of independent expert on the promotion and protection of cultural rights;
(b) Called upon all Governments to cooperate with and assist the independent expert in the discharge of his or her mandate, to provide him or her with all necessary information requested and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to his or her requests to visit their countries in order to enable him or her to effectively fulfil his or her duties;
(c) Requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the independent expert;
(d) Requested the independent expert to submit his or her first report to the Council at its thirteenth session.
11. A total amount of $338,800 per annum or $677,600 per biennium would be required to implement the activities arising from the terms of the resolutions, as follows:
(a) Travel of the independent expert for consultations/to attend the annual meeting of special procedures, to present his or her report to the Council and the General Assembly, two field missions per year and two missions per year to attend and follow up on relevant international conferences and events ($109,800 per biennium under section 23);

(c) Travel of staff to accompany the independent expert during field missions ($20,800 per biennium, under section 23);
(d) Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous expenses during field missions ($8,000 per biennium, under section 23);
(e) One P-3 staff member to assist the independent expert (12 months per year) ($311,000 per biennium, under section 23);
(f) Conference services for the organization of a two-day consultation meeting in each of the three years, involving all relevant stakeholders, to identify proposals enhancing international cooperation, overcome obstacles and fill gaps in the promotion and protection of cultural rights, as well as to clarify the content and scope of cultural diversity ($111,600 per biennium: $108,600 under section 2 and $3,000 under section 28 E);

12. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the independent expert have not been included under sections 2, 23 (Human Rights) and 28 E of the programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009. Although the resource requirements are estimated at a total amount of $338,800 per annum, the actual implementation of the mandate may require a maximum of nine months of resources for 2009. Every effort will be made to meet the estimated requirements within the provisions for the biennium 2008–2009 and to be reported in the context of the second performance for the biennium 2008–2009. Since the period of the mandate of the independent expert would extend to the biennium 2010–2011, the requirements for that period will be presented to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session in a revised estimates report resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council, in the context of its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011. No additional appropriations would be required as a result of the adoption of the draft resolution.
13. With regard to paragraph 9, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, and subsequent resolutions, the most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.
